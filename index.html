          <h2>This brick is designed to give the client a sense of hierarchy, which is meant to echo the presence of nature in the building. However, through the use of colored bricks in an abstract way, the architects have created a unity between the brick pattern and the natural light that is at the base of the building.</h2>

            There were no choices.
            
            There was little voice from within to say "no, I won't do that."
            
            No one gave me a map.
